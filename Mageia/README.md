# Μαγεία (Magic) Mausoleum

> *This document is a foundational placeholder for the Μαγεία Mausoleum. The structure, scope, and content described here are subject to change as the NASGVAM vision evolves and the community refines its approach. Expect significant adaptation and expansion in the future.*

## Purpose

The Μαγεία Mausoleum explores the esoteric, mystical, and alternative traditions that have shaped human culture, imagination, and the boundaries of knowledge. It is a space for rigorous documentation, critical examination, and creative synthesis of knowledge at the edges of the known and unknown.

This Mausoleum does not seek to promote dogma or superstition, but to understand the role of magic, myth, and the esoteric in human development, creativity, and meaning-making.

## Scope

- Esotericism, occultism, and mystical traditions
- Ritual, symbolism, magical systems, and sacred practices
- Alchemy, shamanism, and transformative experiences
- Parapsychology, anomalous phenomena, and the study of the unexplained
- Myth, folklore, archetypes, and the interface between magic and science
- The psychological, cultural, and historical impact of magical thinking

## Structure

- **Cold Files:** Foundational texts, historical records, primary sources, and key figures from magical and esoteric traditions. These files are annotated and contextualized to provide a reliable reference base.
- **Live Files:** Syntheses, critical analyses, comparative studies, and integrative frameworks that contextualize and examine these traditions in relation to other domains. Live Files may explore the psychological, cultural, and symbolic significance of magic, as well as its intersections with science, art, and philosophy.

## Contribution

Contributions should be respectful, critical, and open-minded—neither dismissive nor credulous. The goal is to understand, synthesize, and illuminate, not to promote dogma or debunk for its own sake. Contributors are encouraged to:

- Document and contextualize diverse magical and esoteric traditions.
- Explore the symbolic, psychological, and cultural functions of magic.
- Critically examine claims and practices, referencing both historical and contemporary sources.
- Foster dialogue between the esoteric and the scientific, the rational and the imaginative.
