# Λήθη (Oblivion/Forgetting) Mausoleum

> *This document is a foundational placeholder for the Λήθη Mausoleum. The structure, scope, and content described here are subject to change as the NASGVAM vision evolves and the community refines its approach. Expect significant adaptation and expansion in the future.*

## Purpose

The Λήθη Mausoleum is the domain of science and history—dedicated to the empirical record of humanity and the synthesis of our scientific and historical understanding. It serves as the foundation for reliable, evidence-based knowledge, and as the starting point for all further synthesis within NASGVAM.

Λήθη is both an archive and a crucible: it preserves the cold, hard facts of discovery and invention, but also enables their integration into broader, more meaningful narratives.

## Scope

- Natural sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, astronomy, etc.)
- Mathematics, logic, and formal systems
- Technology, engineering, and applied sciences
- Medicine, health sciences, and neuroscience
- Archaeology, anthropology, and cultural evolution
- World history, historiography, and the evolution of civilizations
- Philosophy of science, scientific method, and epistemology

## Structure

- **Cold Files:** Archival source material, scientific papers, historical records, established principles, and foundational texts. These files are carefully curated, referenced, and annotated to provide a stable foundation for all further work.
- **Live Files:** Synthesized, up-to-date, and accessible explanations, tutorials, integrative overviews, and cross-disciplinary syntheses. Live Files aim to make complex knowledge understandable and actionable for learners and experts alike.

## Contribution

Contributions should aim to clarify, synthesize, and make accessible the best of scientific and historical knowledge. All work must be referenced, transparent, and open to further synthesis. Contributors are encouraged to:

- Bridge gaps between disciplines and eras.
- Highlight the evolution of ideas and discoveries.
- Address controversies, uncertainties, and the provisional nature of knowledge.
- Foster critical thinking and scientific literacy.

> "To remember is to learn; to synthesize is to understand. Λήθη is where the past becomes the foundation for future wisdom."
